A synergy hub is a new form of organisational set-up ; it is not an organisation as we know it; it is a dedicated space for free interactions and creative endeavors within an hosting space supporting the highest synergistic potentials for generative and regenerative value creation. It is supporting the emergence of a vibrant social ecosystem composed of teams and individuals that can be independent or willfully bound by customized and evolving agreements. The hosting team of such a hub may dedicate the (co-creating / co-working and/or co-living) space to a specific vision, spirit and purpose, inviting in and gathering resonant peers. 

The Synergy Hub Network is in service of, and to support, the Unifying of the Unifiers process leading towards a Network of Networks / Movement of Movements and co-creating a new regenerative lifestyle blueprint. We are organizing around criteria such as: the UN SDGs (Sunstainable Development Goals) / HackHumanity's RDGs (Regenerative Development Goals) / Transition Tactics / 3-Pillars of Activism / 12-Sectors Wheel of Co-creation.

<!-- Equinox is a special moment when day and night, sun and moon, shine and shade all fall into balance together across the world as yin meets yang. Paradoxically, in this synchronisation, the transition of solar to lunar energy is at its highest potential and most dynamic capacity - from Autumn Equinox onwards we accelerate towards night.
