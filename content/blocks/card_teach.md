Between 2015 and 2021 we initated and co-created several Hubs & Pods around the globe. Here you can find the stories behind the Synergy Hub Rotterdam, NL and more. At the Hubs we experienced open spaces with diverse and interesting groups who are co-creating and organising themselves around a shared collection of narratives to create a better world for all.
