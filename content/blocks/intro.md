Unconferences are loosely structured and coordinated by participants who abide by the law of two feet - if your not recieving value, please find a space where you are or create some value for others! Our themes are open in ethos and non prescribed, anyone can get involved in ways of their own choosing. This is a participatory meeting of hands, heads and hearts in open space to build collective capacity and common potential.

With that said, we are practicing self organisation where no-one and everyone is a facillitator. Please join us this Equinox in a game of artful participation!

<!-- It’s the ‘loosely structured’ of a this kind of event that makes it an un-conference as opposed to a conference. It’s a meeting of minds and hearts where participants are freely roaming. At this equinox unconference one of our themes is self organization. So off course we practice this here as well. And so we’d wanted to say a few words about the structure of a particularly unstructured event. 
We decided we needed some roles and places for the Un-conference, to keep it sort of navigatable

A space keeper keeps track of time and invites participants to continue conversations in break out rooms when in the main room a next session starts again. Off course keep every interesting conversation going. Just get your own space that’s it. 

Tech fairies may (or may not) fix tech issues in the background. If this sounds like you, we’d love to invite you to fairie play with us.

<!-- Equinox is a special moment when day and night, sun and moon, shine and shade all fall into balance together across the world as yin meets yang. Paradoxically, in this synchronisation, the transition of solar to lunar energy is at its highest potential and most dynamic capacity - from Autumn Equinox onwards we accelerate towards night.

What better time to gather around the bonfire together and hold an annual self-organising unconference? -->
